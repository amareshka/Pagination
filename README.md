# Pagination

Fetch Products Data - Usage of fetch api to get the products
Render all Products - Display using map() method
Pagination Implementation - Display page numbers using map() method
Page Selection Logic - Add active or custom class to highlight the current page selected
Next and Previous Page Logic - Next and previous button functionnalities
Backend Driven Approach - there can be n number of products. Need to display 10 products per page. Here while fetching we restrict the backend to provide only 10 records instead of fetching all at once.
